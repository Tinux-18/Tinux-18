## Hi there! I'm Constantin

### I’m a language nerd who loves coding

I come from a humanities background, namely political science,
economics, and languages. Since 2017 I’ve been in the software
development world, specifically machine learning and data engineering.
I moved from student to project manager and finally landed on
developer.

My motto is *Never stop learning*.

This is why I
moved from Data Engineering to Full Stack Development and who knows where I'm going to land next.

<!--- I’m looking forward to working on your next project! --->
